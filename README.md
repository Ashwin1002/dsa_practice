## Maths Formula

Average
`average = sum of n / total length`

Median
Odd median
`(n + 1) / 2`
Even median
`(n/2) + (n/2 + 1) / 2`
where n is the length

Exponent
`a1 * (r^n)`
where,
a1 = first element
r = uniform increasing number
n = length/no of times

Logarithm
A logarithm is the inverse of an exponent.

log216 = 4

"log216" can be read as "log base 2 of 16", and means "the number of times 2 must be multiplied by itself to equal 16".
"log216" might also be written as log2(16)
